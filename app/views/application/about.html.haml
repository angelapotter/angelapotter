    Iâ€™m a designer with serious front-end development skills. I specialize in
    <strong>usability and interaction design</strong>,
    and am great at distilling complex processes down to simple UI. I have experience
    with web and mobile design, and I code in <strong>HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery</strong>

    Right now I'm a UI/UX designer at #{ link_to 'Goldbely', 'https://goldbely.com', class: 'link--text' }, a website where you can order iconic regional dishes from across the USA, shipped to your door.
