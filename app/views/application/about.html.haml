  %h3.heading--section What motivates me
  %p
    I love removing friction from people's lives so they can focus on their passions.
  %p
    Humans have a limited supply of cognitive resources. They should spend these resources on the things they care about, not figuring out how to use software.

  %h3.heading--section My strengths

  %p
    I take design from ideation through implementation. I use a combination of quantitative and qualitative data to solve problems and reach business goals. When I talk to users, I dig deep to uncover their true needs and goals.

  %p
    I think big but start small. I'm always weighing tradeoffs of delivering immediate value while moving toward the long-term vision.
  %p
    I have a background in front-end development and love working with engineers. Undestanding technical constraints is a big part of the job. I work best when I'm rapidly iterating with a small cross-functional team.

  %h3.heading--section How to reach me

  %p
    I'm open to new opportunities. Send me an email at #{ mail_to contact_info.email, contact_info.email, class: 'text-link--primary' } if youâ€™d like to get in touch!
